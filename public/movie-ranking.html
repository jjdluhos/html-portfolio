<h1>Jarret's Top Movies</h1>
<h2>Below are my top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
    <p>This is an amazing action/drama movie.  The movie stars Russel Crowe and has really intense action scenes with a lot of blood and gore.</p>
<h3>Split</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite scary/horror/suspense movie of all time.  This movie is about a man with multiple split personalities and explores the idea of him being superhuman.</p>
<h3>V for Vendetta</h3>
    <p>This is a very intellectually stimulating movie.  The movie explores the complexity of power and fear used by governments to control thier populace.</p>
